    <!-- Personal & Professional Info -->
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I am originally from North Africa and now live in the U.S., balancing being a mom, working, and going to school. I enjoy learning new things, especially in technology, and I’m focused on building a better future for myself and my family.</li>
      <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> I currently work as a Banker at Truist Bank. Before that, I worked in fashion retail stores, gaining experience in customer service and sales. I’m gaining both sales and tech skills and working toward transitioning into a tech-related role in the future.</li>
      <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I am pursuing a degree in Full Stack Programming. I have completed courses in Python, software development, and project management. This semester I am focusing on web development and professional communication to strengthen both technical and workplace skills.</li>
      <li><strong>Background in this Subject:</strong> I don’t have much coding experience but have used software like MATLAB and ANSYS. Those gave me a small introduction to programming, but I’m still new overall. I’m looking forward to building my skills in this class.</li>
      <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> I mainly use a Windows computer for schoolwork and daily tasks, running Windows 11.</li>
      <li><strong>Courses I’m Taking & Why:</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>WEB-115: Web Markup and Scripting – To deepen my knowledge of HTML and CSS, building on WEB-110.</li>
          <li>WEB-140: Web Development Tools – To gain hands-on experience with web application tools for current projects and future tech roles.</li>
          <li>CTS-118: IS Professional Communication – To improve my ability to explain technical information clearly for client interactions and teamwork.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember Me By:</strong> I measure productivity in cups of coffee.</li>
      <li><strong>Also to Share:</strong> When I’m in the U.S., I miss Algeria; when I’m in Algeria, I miss the U.S. Sometimes it feels like I don’t fully exist in either place.</li>
    </ul>
