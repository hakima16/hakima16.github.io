    <h1>Hakima Chabane Web115-N801 Course Contract</h1>

    <p>
      I, Hakima Chabane, agree to abide by the terms of
      the course contract in my Web115-N801 (Fall 2025) with my instructor,
      Ella McManus.
    </p>

    <p>
      I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will
      be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is
      inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins
      or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
    </p>

    <p>Signed: Hakima Chabane, 09/05/2025</p>
